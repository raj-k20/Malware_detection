# Malware_detection
This project aims to perform malware detection on files whose system call requests are recorded ,
basically this is a static analysis based malware detection.The folders benign1 and malware1 contains
the training datasets,which are text files containing hexadecimal numbers each of it depicting a system call.
We have used gain ratio method of feature selection for determining the hexadecimal numbers or system calls which
determine whether a given file is benign or malware.Based on selected features from gain ratio we have applied 
Support Vector Machine learning algorith using sklearn modules to train and store the results in cPickle file.
The tester folder contains some sample file for which we run the program to analyze the performance of the algorithm
